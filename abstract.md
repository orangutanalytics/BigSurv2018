Spark and Scala have enabled many statisticians to work with big data in distributed computing environments. Much of the work with Spark has focused on broader statistical, and machine learning methods. As a result, there has not been a lot of development in specialized areas like complex survey variance estimation. In our paper, we demonstrate that many complex survey estimators have the necessary algebraic properties for distributed computing, and we present our Scala library for high-performance complex survey analysis.
